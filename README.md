In a college this huge, you would think finding a teammate for a hackathon or someone to play badminton with you would be an easy task, well... it's not.

We faced a similar issue while applying for WT22, finding a team with 50% women candidates was a task, leave alone an all women team. My friend faces a similar issue on finding girls to play volleyball with. To help you with this we got WOMANCE.

Womance, currently catering to girls at VIT. lets you choose exactly the type of buddy you want depending upon the current mood - want to do something tech related, want to talk about sports, want a study buddy or just want someone to vibe with, you can do it all!

And you know the best part about it?! WE MATCH PEOPLE BASED ON THE FREE SLOTS on their timetable!
